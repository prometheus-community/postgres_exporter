## 0.13.0 / 2023-06-21

BREAKING CHANGES:

Please note, the following features are deprecated and may be removed in a future release:
- `auto-discover-databases`
- `extend.query-path`
- `constantLabels`
- `exclude-databases`
- `include-databases`

This exporter is meant to monitor PostgresSQL servers, not the user data/databases. If
you need a generic SQL report exporter https://github.com/burningalchemist/sql_exporter
is recommended.

PostgreSQL servers from a single exporter by passing the target via URL
params. See the Multi-Target Support section of the README.

* Export pg_stat_archiver metrics (#324)
* Add support for 'DATA_SOURCE_URI_FILE' envvar.
* Resolve #329
* Added new field "master" to queries.yaml. (credit to @sfalkon)
  - If "master" is true, query will be call only on once database in instance

  - added current database name to metrics because any database in cluster maybe have the same table names
  - added "master" field for query instance metrics.

## 0.7.0 / 2019-11-01

Introduces some more significant changes, hence the minor version bump in
such a short time frame.

* Rename pg_database_size to pg_database_size_bytes in queries.yml.
* Add pg_stat_statements to sample queries.yml file.

* Expose pg_current_wal_lsn_bytes (#307)
* [minor] fix landing page content-type (#305)

* Add retries to getServer() (#316)

## 0.5.1 / 2019-07-09

* Add application_name as a label for pg_stat_replication metrics (#285).

## 0.5.0 / 2019-07-03

It's been far too long since I've done a release and we have a lot of accumulated changes.

* Docker image now runs as a non-root user named "postgres_exporter"
* Add `--auto-discover-databases` option, which automatically discovers and scrapes all databases.
* Add support for boolean data types as metrics
* Replication lag is now expressed as a float and not truncated to an integer.
* When default metrics are disabled, no version metrics are collected anymore either.
* BUGFIX: Fix exporter panic when postgres server goes down.
* Add support for collecting metrics from multiple servers.
* PostgreSQL 11 is now supported in the integration tests.

## 0.4.7 / 2018-10-02

* Added a query for v9.1 pg_stat_activity.
* Add `--constantLabels` flag to allow applying fixed constant labels to metrics.
* queries.yml: dd pg_statio_user_tables.
* Support 'B' suffix in units.

## 0.4.6 / 2018-04-15

* Fix issue #173 - 32 and 64mb unit sizes were not supported in pg_settings.

## 0.4.5 / 2018-02-27

* Add commandline flag to disable default metrics (thanks @hsun-cnnxty)

## 0.4.4 / 2018-03-21

* Bugfix for 0.4.3 which broke pg_up (it would always be 0).
* pg_up is now refreshed based on database Ping() every scrape.
* Re-release of 0.4.4 to fix version numbering.

## 0.4.2 / 2018-02-19

* Adds the following environment variables for overriding defaults:
    * `PG_EXPORTER_WEB_LISTEN_ADDRESS`
    * `PG_EXPORTER_WEB_TELEMETRY_PATH`
    * `PG_EXPORTER_EXTEND_QUERY_PATH`

* Add Content-Type to HTTP landing page.
* Fix Makefile to produce .exe binaries for Windows.

## 0.4.1 / 2017-11-30

* No code changes to v0.4.0 for the exporter.
* First release switching to tar-file based distribution.
* First release with Windows and Darwin cross-builds.\\

## 0.4.0 / 2017-11-29

* Fix panic due to inconsistent label cardinality when using queries.yaml with
  queries which return extra columns.
* Add metric for whether the user queries YAML file parsed correctly. This also
  includes the filename and SHA256 sum allowing tracking of updates.
* Add pg_up metric to indicate whether the exporter was able to connect and
  Ping() the PG instance before a scrape.
* Fix broken link in landing page for `/metrics`

## 0.3.0 / 2017-10-23

* Add support for PostgreSQL 10.

## 0.2.3 / 2017-09-07

* Add support for the 16kB unit when decoding pg_settings. (#101)

## 0.2.2 / 2017-08-04

* Fix DSN logging. The exporter previously never actually logged the DSN when
  database connections failed. This was also masking a logic error which could
  potentially lead to a crash when DSN was unparseable, though no actual
  crash could be produced in testing.

## 0.2.1 / 2017-06-07

* Ignore functions that cannot be executed during replication recovery (#52)
* Add a `-version` flag finally.
* Add confirmed_flush_lsn to pg_stat_replication.

## 0.2.0 / 2017-04-18

* Major change - use pg_settings to retrieve runtime variables. Adds >180
  new metrics and descriptions (big thanks to Matt Bostock for this work).

  Removes the following metrics:
  ```
  pg_runtime_variable_max_connections
  pg_runtime_variable_max_files_per_process
  pg_runtime_variable_max_function_args
  pg_runtime_variable_max_identifier_length
  pg_runtime_variable_max_index_keys
  pg_runtime_variable_max_locks_per_transaction
  pg_runtime_variable_max_pred_locks_per_transaction
  pg_runtime_variable_max_prepared_transactions
  pg_runtime_variable_max_standby_archive_delay_milliseconds
  pg_runtime_variable_max_standby_streaming_delay_milliseconds
  pg_runtime_variable_max_wal_senders
  ```

  They are replaced by equivalent names under `pg_settings` with the exception of
  ```
  pg_runtime_variable_max_standby_archive_delay_milliseconds
  pg_runtime_variable_max_standby_streaming_delay_milliseconds
  ```
  which are replaced with
  ```
  pg_settings_max_standby_archive_delay_seconds
  pg_settings_max_standby_streaming_delay_seconds
  ```

## 0.1.3 / 2017-02-21

  filter problem.
