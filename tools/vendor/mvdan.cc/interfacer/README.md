A linter that suggests interface types. In other words, it warns about
the usage of types that are more specific than necessary.

	go get -u mvdan.cc/interfacer

### Usage

```go
func ProcessInput(f *os.File) error {
        b, err := ioutil.ReadAll(f)
        if err != nil {
                return err
        }
        return processBytes(b)
}
```

```sh
$ interfacer $(go list ./... | grep -v /vendor/)
foo.go:10:19: f can be io.Reader
```

### Basic idea

This tool inspects the parameters of your functions to see if they fit
an interface type that is less specific than the current type.

The example above illustrates this point. Overly specific interfaces
also trigger a warning - if `f` were an `io.ReadCloser`, the same
message would appear.

It suggests interface types defined both in the func's package and the
package's imports (two levels; direct imports and their direct imports).

### False positives

To avoid false positives, it never does any suggestions on functions
that may be implementing an interface method or a named function type.

It also skips parameters passed by value (excluding pointers and
interfaces) on unexported functions, since that would introduce extra
allocations where they are usually not worth the tradeoff.

### Suppressing warnings

If a suggestion is technically correct but doesn't make sense, you can
still suppress the warning by mentioning the type in the function name:

```go
func ProcessInputFile(f *os.File) error {
	// use as an io.Reader
}
```
